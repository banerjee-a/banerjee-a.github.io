In response to [this facebook post][fb-link].

Keep regular in your studies and the opportunities will present themselves. First things first, target a merit based waiver. After you complete 30 credits (takes 3 semester), BRACU awards waivers based on your CGPA. If you are majoring in CSE, for maintaining grade, study at home exactly what you were taught in class, on the same day. Every little doubts you have in your answers, please clarify them from your teachers and STs. **Every day you delay, you burden yourself.** Rather, try your best to stay ahead of the syllabus. After completing 80 credits (in 3rd year), you will be able to apply for ST and Mentor positions. But in this time in between, on your 2nd year, start writing a CV. Make a goal that every semester you will add at least one more item (personal project, club activity, software skill) to grow your profile, while maintaining grades, too. Even if you aren't successful first time, this will develop a work ethic and hard working mentality, putting you ahead of everyone.

I am also from a middle class family, followed those steps above, received waivers from 4th semester, became ST on 7th, and now I am at a place where I can be happy to help my parents.

Wishing you all the best!
