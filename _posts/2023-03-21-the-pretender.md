To my understanding, many acknowledge me as someone smart, talented and academically gifted. This post is to say, it's all a facade. More accurately, while those things are not entirely false, I doubt that I deserve the highlights it gets me. The story behind is as follows. (Long post warning. TL;DR: Imposter Syndrome)

I am an extroverted person, but I didn't know how to talk to people because almost everyone in my household is an introvert. Studying alone doesn't work for me. I get anxious and talk to myself too much. I am lucky that there are youtube, anime and tv shows that I can go to as a conversation supplement. In school, I was average, people knew me as the nice kid, who followed all the rules, and knew more about the internet than the average kid. In class 9, something happened and I needed to prove myself as better. I did do better. It was to show off to someone that I have the potential, but by the time the results came, it didn't matter. What that did, however, prove to me that I didn't have a goal for studying. I just do it because of "the rules". During a similar time, I started experimenting with blender and illustrator, while also working with some "super-friends" on a comic and a magazine; I felt fulfilled and inspired. I made a 1 to 1 model of the Monipur School boys campus, where every brick, railing, and windows were accurate. What complicates all of this is that one time that I wanted to show off, and did get better scores, while I didn't get to show off to the person, it did put me in a better place in school, and those inspirations would not have come if not for the trying. What I took from all this is that, I thrive to be among real people, I am inspired when I can communicate, not just some characters on screen. And to get to that point, to meet more real people, I needed to be fake, I needed to "appear good", for not the results, but to get people's attention, and meet people.

In college, I was the first person to submit the admission fees, and acquired the first roll number in my section. Perfect for keeping up the act. But this time, I learned balance. I was performing better but nothing overwhelming. I still had no idea how to study by myself. But I guess what worked for me is spending more time with the teachers and always coming to the exam halls 2 to 3 hrs early and "communicating" what my "real" talented friends studied. Yep, that's all it took. I can keep playing it cool as long as I can keep being in the midst of the cool people. I can't study but I can give decent enough exams, this was the hack I played with to stay roughly above average. And I was passing the days as they came, going with the flow.
The person I tried to show off to, in class 9, was a teacher. I really turn to them for most of my personal problems. It was the science fair at the college, and I volunteered to be on duty to prepare the PCs for the programming contest event. There was another teacher, on duty supervising the event. She was also a teacher in my section. As soon as the clock started, she locked the door, and came to me, with a stern tone, 'convinced' me to attempt the contest. I had barely started programming by then, and over the whole 3 hours, I struggled to find how to tell if a year is leap year or not, and to find gcd in code. I couldn't solve anything. But, the whole time she stood behind me. After the time ended, I was obviously embarrassed, but she just told me, "পরের বার ফাটায়ে দিবো!". She was acting as a contestant too. And I was her problem to solve. This connected me back to my roots. It reminded me that I am pretending to be good, not just to meet new people, but to be inspired and be more of myself, my creative self. As a result, I became more invested in customizing themes and fiddling around phones and my PC. I became the vice president of a club. I also started to be more and more "computer nerd" and less and less "academic". And in the end, my HSC results were sub-par. (Side story: after the university admissions test, I had the opportunity to study applied math in Rajshahi University, and Computer Science and Engineering in BracU, both very attractive to me. I went to that teacher again, and she recommended that I study CSE. That moment is why I have an engineering degree now.)

At the university, first year was probably when the most happened. Family issues, fear of hospitals, residential semester and the cherry on top, academic pressure. I simply got lucky that most CSE stuff that is covered in the first year, I already knew from school days to college days. Helping me to keep on the good student act. While I was in college, I kept up my practice of 3D modeling, art and environment designs. Well, until my laptop broke. I had a potato PC that couldn't really keep up either. After the first year, my cgpa was 3.9 and I was awarded a 50% waiver. Now the facade got a different incentive, money. With the saved money, I convinced my family to spend some more for a new PC, and I was back on the 3D track. I started trying out game development as well. Everything was going so smooth for a month or so, until literally the world got diseased. It was around midterm, results got published, and I was in risk of losing the scholarship. Then, I had to start making sacrifices, to keep up being this high-scorer, to keep the waiver. It locked me in. During the 2nd year, I still watched anime and youtube, played some games on the new pc, but slowed down on doing things for myself. By third year, I had a 75% waiver and the pressure was unbearable. My only productive escape was the nicest ever friends and the chess club. All the rest of me was taken over by the facade. And I started having doubts. I liked to be fake because it brought me closer to people, now, it's driving me out of it. I yearned for it all to stop, to have something new, something that helps to exercise my extrovert, creative self. Which was difficult being locked at home during the pandemic, in between deadlines.

Then, it paid off, to some extent. I got appointed as a student tutor. A position that not only allows, but promotes me to be my extrovert-self and keep pretending. It gave me new incentives to keep trying to be better, it wasn't a fake goal, it was real. It showed me how to be both. Then everything opened up, and I could meet people again. It was the best thing that possibly could have happened. I loved my final year, including all the suffering and effort, it all really felt worth it. I had found purpose in academic success. But as it comes to a close, while the act gave me something I don't ever want to give up, I realize that I had lost everything I used to enjoy. I haven't touched comics in years, I don't enjoy playing long games, I hardly get hyped about the newest tech, I do not even sit on the PC that serves as a symbol of my award to myself for keeping up the act. I keep looking at job postings, those of the ones whose requirements I meet, I just psych myself out thinking I cannot keep doing that for longer than a year. What do I enjoy now? Well, I like to give good exams. I think that's all that's left of me now, just the number I graduated with, 3.96. I'm sure I would have turned out very differently if I had given up earlier. But I don't like talking about "what if"s, because that would mean I may not have ever experienced those creative and extroverted parts of myself to begin with.

I keep seeing a bunch of people posting "signing off # student-id". I don't think I want to. I'd like to keep up the facade, I'd like to always be ID#19101541. Because, I'm not sure I can be anyone else. I'll keep on acting, hoping it'll pay off again.
