I'm very content with my student life because of all the wonderful teachers I've had.
I find it unbelievably fascinating sometimes when a teacher goes to unconventional means to give a lesson.
I always feel like I don't appreciate their efforts enough. After all, what options do I have, to repay these? I am not creative enough.

I figured out one way, acing the class.

To me, it makes sense, without any context, 10 billion sounds a lot more exciting than, let's say, 50. It's often pleasing to find something standing out, albeit not out of place.
I don't have a particular goal for studying, I push forward just so I can stand my ground and be a prove to these teachers - sort of like yelling at them, 
> "Yes, you made me like this, **I** am your trophy!"

I don't enjoy being at the spotlight indefinitely. I get sick of people trying to avoid me. It's still fun for the most part though. And if I have the skills to help people, it slowly develops a path to make friends anyway.

I wasn't this addicted to attention before - 6 years before. It was 6 years ago when I found out the hard way that these amazing people generally don't wait/ask for/give enough chance for showing admiration.

    The man in the photo has had more impact in building up my life than I can ever admit. The most influential teacher of my life, passed away 6 years ago, on this day. May his soul rest in peace.
    I only hope his efforts were not wasted on me.
