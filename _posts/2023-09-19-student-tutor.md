One of the most significant parts of my undergraduate life was the time I served as a student tutor (st). For those unfamiliar, it's basically a part time position, similar to undergraduate teaching assistants, except for being assigned to a particular teacher, student tutors are assigned to groups/sections of students.


I am very fortunate to have learned from some teachers, who I idolize to this very day. Being someone even remotely comparable to them, seems completely impossible in my lifespan. But, somehow, I am, with all my doubts and weaknesses, also a teacher now. And this started with me being an ST.


I was genuinely lost during the pandemic times. As the only effective goal I had, was to score high in exams. While I enjoyed learning many of the materials, the outcome, felt mundane. Until I was selected for this position. It gave me a new purpose. It showed me a version of myself that could be. Yes, sometimes the workload was hard, but it also paid my tuition!


One of the students I had the opportunity to be responsible for, on my first time as an ST, got appointed as an ST today. I know I am nowhere near being able to impact so much as my respected teachers. But I hope one day, they also feel such incredible pride for me, that I am feeling right now.


Thank you for the great news, and congratulations again Farah Ulfat Zaima! Surely the road goes much much farther than this milestone.

Edit: Seems that there were others too, that I weren't aware of. You're all wonderful people, and I think you yourself should know that now, because of your current position.
